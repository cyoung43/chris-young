Recent grad of BYU's Master of Information Systems Management program. Currently, I work as a data engineer at Eide Bailly.

I like to dabble in all things data, sports analytics, development, and cloud ops. 

I am driven by team environments where we tackle challenging issues. I love finding creative and innovative solutions for all types of problems.

Enjoys basketball, golf, Star Wars, coding, hiking, MarioKart, and more!
