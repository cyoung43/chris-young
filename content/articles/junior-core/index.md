I started the BYU Information Systems program in Fall 2019. To give some context of how I found the best major on campus is somewhat of a journey. I started BYU in the fall of 2017, fresh off a mission to Bacolod, Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­. I drew inspiration from my Mission President and tried my hand at Civil Engineering. Unfortunately, I couldn't fathom taking Calculus II and other math classes down the road.

The next semester, I looked into pre-med with the hopes of being an ophthalmologist. Again, I couldn't get imagine taking more Chemistry and eventually oChem classes so after returning home for the summer, I looked into business, specifically, Accounting.

I loved my Accounting 200 class. I had finally found a class that made sense to me and something that I was good at. I enrolled in Accounting 310, and as part of the pre-reqs, IS 201. While I loved my accounting classes, the idea of diving into company financials and audits and taxes wasn't particularly appealing to me -- even if I was good at it.

On the other hand, my IS class was interesting, something new, and fueled my interest and learning like never before. I took IS 303 -- Introduction to JavaScript -- in Spring 2019, and absolutely loved the programming and problem-solving aspect of IS. I applied to both the Accounting and Information Systems programs in the summer, and luckily was accepted to both.

### Junior Core
The Junior Core kicked off with the classic "EY Case". This was a week-long simulation of working as cyber consultants for the firm and analyzing results from the penetration tests done by another team. Our job was to suggest a course of action for the company as well as a new security strategy for them moving forward. This was a huge learning experience for me and my team because we really had no idea what we were doing.

#### Fall Junior Core
During the fall, I took 4 courses that were a part of the standard curriculum for the Core. These classes were:
1. `IS 401` - Systems Analysis and Design. This class was all about understanding business processes and requirements and then designing entire applications and systems that would work for business.
2. `IS 402` - Database Systems. This class focused primarily on SQL -- functions, subqueries, ctes, as well as normalization and designing ERDs. I learned a ton in this class that I still use a lot in my job today.
3. `IS 403` - Principles of Business Programming. This was the hardest class of the semester for me. We learned C# and ASP.NET. I struggled with understanding the MVC logic and coding in such a strongly-typed language. While still a good experience, I wish I would have understood more in that class. I could have done a lot more if I was taking that class now as opposed to then.
4. `IS 405` - Project Mangement. This was an interesting course. There was a huge textbook and guidelines for Project Management and I didn't really ever see myself needing that information. With my perspective now however, I see that the further you progress in your career, the more you move away from technical work and towards managerial work. That means being a project/product manager, stakeholder, etc. I should probably review my notes from this course.

We finished off the semester with Intex (Integrated Exercise). After a long week of building, we felt like we had developed a solid MVP. Our assumptions were flawed and were quickly pointed out during our presentation -- but I look back now and it seems so crazy with how much I have grown.

#### Winter Junior Core
In the winter, there was another 12 credits worth of classes to take. 
1. `IS 404` - Network and Cloud Infrastructure. The physical networking/hardware unit of this class was somewhat interesting, but I continue to be intrigued by the Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) even now. I hope to continue to get better at Cloud Ops/Infrastructure.
2. `IS 413` - Enterprise Application Development. This was probably in my top 5 most valuable courses I took at BYU. Dr. Albrecht taught us DRF (Django-Rest Framework) for the backend, and React for the frontend. I'm not sure if they are continuing React in the core now, but what a valuable skill to learn. I love React and I learned so much that semester.
3. `IS 414` - Security & Controls. This was an introductory course to security and managin strategies for firm cyber practices. Kind of dry, focused on frameworks, procedures, and strategy, but still interesting.
4. `IS 415` - Machine Learning. In this class, I first learned Python. Another extremely valuable skill that I use in my job almost every day. Learned a lot about algorithms, data cleaning and transformation, and how to deploy algorithms to enable continual learning and improvement (beginning of CI/CD).

After Intex II, my group and I placed second overall! Wow, we were so impressed. We developed a React/Django machine learning application and were really impressed with what we accomplished.
### Wrap-up
And that is a wrap of the Junior Core! I had a great year, I grew significantly in my skills and understanding, and ended up doing well enough to be accepted to the MISM.
