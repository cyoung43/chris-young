I started the BYU Information Systems program in Fall 2019. To give some context of how I found the best major on campus is somewhat of a journey. I started BYU in the fall of 2017, fresh off a mission to Bacolod, Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­. I drew inspiration from my Mission President and tried my hand at Civil Engineering. Unfortunately, I couldn't fathom taking Calculus II and other math classes down the road.

The next semester, I looked into pre-med with the hopes of being an ophthalmologist. Again, I couldn't get imagine taking more Chemistry and eventually oChem classes so after returning home for the summer, I looked into business, specifically, Accounting.

I loved my Accounting 200 class. I had finally found a class that made sense to me and something that I was good at. I enrolled in Accounting 310, and as part of the pre-reqs, IS 201. While I loved my accounting classes, the idea of diving into company financials and audits and taxes wasn't particularly appealing to me -- even if I was good at it.

On the other hand, my IS class was interesting, something new, and fueled my interest and learning like never before. I took IS 303 -- Introduction to JavaScript -- in Spring 2019, and absolutely loved the programming and problem-solving aspect of IS. I applied to both the Accounting and Information Systems programs in the summer, and luckily was accepted to both.

### Junior Core
The Junior Core kicked off with the classic "EY Case". This was a week-long simulation of working as cyber consultants for the firm and analyzing results from the penetration tests done by another team. Our job was to suggest a course of action for the company as well as a new security strategy for them moving forward. This was a huge learning experience for me and my team because we really had no idea what we were doing.

#### Fall Junior Core
During the fall, I took 4 courses that were a part of the standard curriculum for the Core. These classes were:
1. IS 401 -
