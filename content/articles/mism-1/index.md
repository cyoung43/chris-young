As we continue on my journey in the BYU Information Systems program, I should probably mention a little bit about covid-19. In my security class (IS 414) we had to give a presentation about a recent security topic or trend that was on the news. This was the middle of February and covid was starting to pick up pace in Seattle, but as of yet, no shutdowns were initiated. We gave a great presentation that was funny (our news came from phony health inspectors that would come to homes requiring covid inspections) and yet had a odd foreshadowing effect. No more than two weeks later, it seemed like the whole world had shut down after Rudy Gobert tested positive for covid-19. Within 24 hours, the NBA was shutdown, my #14 ranked Cougars had their March Madness run cancelled, and worst of all, my basketball class was out for the semester.

These changes significantly impacted my learning experience. Suddenly, everything was on Zoom and Slack. It was hard for me to adjust and learn and stay focused in my classes!

With that preface, I will continue my discussion and thoughts about the classes I took during 2020-2021.

### MISM 1
I applied to the MISM (Master of Information Systems Management) in March 2020. I found out later in May that I was accepted to the program! This was an accelerated Master's degree where I would essentially forgo my senior year of college and begin my master level courses in the fall. Seeing as I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do yet, and I felt like I needed another summer to strengthen my resume, I decided to pursue this opportunity.

#### Spring 2020
In the spring after my winter semester had finished, I enrolled in a few general credits and a single IS class
1. `IS 590R` - Sports Analytics. This was one of my favorite courses that I took in the program! It was a special elective that the professors put together last minute as a bonus for the many students with altered summer internship plans. We had many guest speakers from industry, including a data scientist from ESPN, some reps from the Denver Broncos and Sacremento Kings, and more! I really enjoyed the class.

#### Fall MISM 1
This was the semester where you knock out most of the required classes for the MISM. I had four required classes to take during this semester.
1. `IS 531` - Enterprise Infrastructure. This class was heavily focused on managing infrastructure at the CTO/CIO level. I learned a lot about scripting, operating systems, active directory management, and AWS Cloud Ops. As a result of this class, I had set a goal to take the AWS Solutions Architect exam -- which I still have yet to do. I hope to finish up my study of it soon however and pass the certification.
2. `HRM 540` - Organizational Behavior. This was an all-time course during my program. I loved the content, the professor, and the well thought out activities that were designed to help us learn and grow. I highly recommend this course with Professor Bednar.
3. `IS 555` - Advanced Data Analytics. This course compounded on what I learned in `IS 415`, yet with a heavier focus on machine learning algorithms and interpretation of fit and results. I learned a lot in that class about how to select the right model and fine tune it for the dataset to get the best results possible.
4. `IS 560` - Information Security Management. This was another one of my favorite classes that had great content and great application outside the classroom. I learned how to see things at the CIO-level, like crafting a response plan in event of a system breach, to ethical hacking and ensuring your defenses are strong enough. A tremendous class.
